Description: 
This project is to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. 
Your code should be able to read a data file consisting of many lines (an example file called data31.txt will be given, explained below)
and will be able to find the lowest cost paths (findShortestPath function) and display the cost and path from every node to every other
node (displayAll function). Another display routine (display function) will output one path in detail. 

In the input data (e.g., data31.txt), the first line tells the number of nodes, say n, 
followed by a text description of each of the 1 through n nodes one description per line (50 chars max length).  
After that, each line consists of 3 integers representing an edge. If there is an edge from node 1 to node 2 with a label of 10,
the data is: 1 2 10. If the first integer is zero, it means the end of the data for that one graph. 
There may be several graphs, each having at most 100 nodes.
